        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Heidi, a student studying Art and Technology at Hong Kong Baptist
          University. As a transdisciplinary student at HKBU, I’m passionate
          about merging art and technology to craft innovative and meaningful
          digital experiences. Whether it’s developing games, designing
          interactive media, or exploring the creative possibilities of
          generative art, I thrive on pushing the boundaries of creativity and
          technology. This website documents my work. Feel free to explore and
          reach out to me!
